# UCF-Crime Anomaly Detection Bootcamp


## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for performing video-level anomaly detection on the UCF-Crime dataset. 



## Structure
The following is the structure of the UCF-Crime directory:

* [dataset.py](./UCF-Crime/dataset.py): contains code for loading extracted features from the UCF-Crime dataset.
* [learner.py](./UCF-Crime/learner.py): contains code to implement a weakly supervised anomaly detection model based on the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework.
* [loss.py](./UCF-Crime/loss.py): contains code for a custom loss function within the MIL framework
* [main.py](./UCF-Crime/main.py): contains code for training and testing the implemented anomaly detection (AD) method
* [UCF-Crime_demo.ipynb](./UCF-Crime/UCF-Crime_demo.ipynb): a notebook to experiment with the implemented MIL based Anomaly Detection Model
<!-- * [UCF-Crime_demo.ipynb](./UCSDPedestraian/UCSDPedestrain_demo.ipynb): a notebook to experiment with MIL algorithm -->
