# Video Anomaly Detection Demo

## Introduction
In this repository, we provide codes to run two categories of video anomaly detection algorithms on two different datasets. The two categories are:
1) Usupervised video anomaly detection algorithm (Diversity Measurable Anomaly Detection) on UCSD Pedestrain dataset
2) Weakly supervised video anomaly detection algorithm (Two-stream I3D Convolutional Network) on UCF Crime dataset

## Structure
The following is the directory structure of the Video Anomaly Detection directory:

* [UCF_crime/](./UCF_crime) ==> contains codes for weakly supervised video anomaly detection
* [UCSD_pedestrain/](./UCSDPedestraian) ==> contains codes for unsupervised video anomaly detection
